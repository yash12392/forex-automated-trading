A simple Moving Average strategy for applying to Forex Markets

I have demonstrated the strategy used by Dr. Yves Hilpisch which he developed for forex trading.

This is a fairly simple strategy where we compare two Simple Moving Averages.
I have used MA for 5 days and MA for 15 days.

IMPORTANT: This backtesting strategy does not guarantee any personal or big returns to the people who will be using it. 
It was developed just for testing purposes and is not used commercially also by the author.

All the code is tested on a test account provided by Oanda (A Leader in automated forex trading with open APIs)
They have a fairly good documentation for using their Rest API.

Have a good time seeing the magic of Automation.
